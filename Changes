=item 1.02 - January 9, 1997

Improved documentation.

Modified Makefile.PL to change traffic script's #! path to $Config{perlpath} 

Modified traffic script to handle date ranges and removal function.
Date::Parse is now required.

Patched IPC::Shareable 0.28 to handle semaphore overflow.

Semaphore locking is now handled by us to take advantage of the
SEM_UNDO flag. IPC::SysV is now required.  

Old data is now transparently stored in a DBM file to reduce logging time.
DB_File is now required.

Fake users can now be used in Owner variables, in which case the names
are stored (rather than their non-existent UIDs).

Using GM time now so daylight savings time doesn't bite us.

Rarely called fuctions are now autoloaded.

Moved logger to $r->post_connection as suggested by Tom <tom@SDF.COM>, with
patch from Doug MacEachern.

Shared memory tie is now persistent as suggested by Stephane Bortzmeyer.

not exist. Suggested by Stephane Bortzmeyer.
